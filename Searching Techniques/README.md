# 🔍 Search Algorithms in C

Welcome to the **Search Algorithms** section of the **Basic DSA** repository! 🚀  
This folder contains simple and well-explained C programs that demonstrate **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** — two of the most fundamental algorithms in Data Structures.

## 📚 Overview

Searching is one of the most common operations in data structures.  
Here, you’ll explore how to find an element in an array using different techniques and approaches:

| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 🧩 **LinearBinarySearch.c** | Implements Linear and Binary Search using simple arrays. | Arrays, Loops, Conditional logic |
| 🧠 **LinearBinarySearchPointers.c** | Demonstrates both searches using **pointers** for element access. | Pointers, Array traversal |
| 👨‍🏫 **LinearBinarySearchStruct.c** | Uses **structures** to store student data and perform searches by roll number. | Structures, Loops, Searching in complex data |

## 🧮 Algorithm Basics

### 🔹 Linear Search
- Checks each element one by one until the key is found (or not found).
- Works on **unsorted data**.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

### 🔹 Binary Search
- Works only on **sorted data**.
- Divides the array in half repeatedly to locate the key faster.

**Time Complexity:** O(log n)

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open any `.c` file in your code editor (like **VS Code** or **Dev-C++**).
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter array elements and choose the search type.

## 🌱 Why This Folder is Useful

✔️ Simple, beginner-friendly code  
✔️ Demonstrates how **one problem** (searching) can be solved in multiple ways  
✔️ Strengthens understanding of **arrays, pointers, and structures**  
✔️ Builds a strong foundation for more advanced algorithms

## 💡 Tips for Students

- Try adding your own inputs and observe how Linear and Binary Search differ.  
- Modify the array size or data type to explore flexibility.  
- Experiment by adding descending sorted arrays for Binary Search and see what happens!
